I did a chatbot project using python,NLP and generative AI technology which are freely available for users.The welcome interface looks like the below picture.

It we select the "chat with PDFs" option.Then the interface will look like this.

Once we upload the PDF files,we can ask our chatbot about the PDFs and it will answer us according to our requirements.

Another option is "chat with assistant".Here we can chat with our chatbot which is trained predefined on knowledge base.

we can also store and check our chatbot history by appending the messgaes to session variable.

I also integrate these two features which can enable us to serach for query in web and in user given files at once.

I also embedded an option for further development where developers can embedd new features like weather reporting and news availability.
